## Test Execution

The tests are configured to run with:
```bash
# Run all browser tests
php artisan test --testsuite=Browser

# Run specific test file
php artisan test tests/Browser/AuthenticationTest.php

# Run with stop on failure
php artisan test --testsuite=Browser --stop-on-failure
```

## Notes

1. **Database Setup**: Tests require the test database to be seeded with the test user (`alfredo@5e.cr` with password `Test123!`)

2. **Application Running**: Browser tests require the application to be running on the configured URL (typically `http://surreal-pilot.local`)

3. **Chrome Driver**: Tests use Chrome WebDriver for browser automation

4. **Mobile Testing**: All major features include mobile responsiveness tests

5. **Error Handling**: Tests include both positive and negative test cases with proper error validation

## Test Coverage Statistics

- **Total Browser Tests**: 80+ individual test cases
- **Total Feature Tests**: 50+ API and integration tests  
- **Coverage Areas**: 10 major feature areas
- **Mobile Tests**: All major features tested on mobile viewport
- **End-to-End Tests**: 4 complete user workflow tests

This comprehensive test suite ensures that all major features of the SurrealPilot application are thoroughly tested from both API and user interface perspectives, providing confidence in the application's reliability and user experience.
