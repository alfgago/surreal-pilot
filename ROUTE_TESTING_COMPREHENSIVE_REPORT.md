# Comprehensive Route Testing Report

**Date:** August 27, 2025  
**Status:** üîß IN PROGRESS - Fixing Route Issues

## Issues Identified

### 1. ‚úÖ FIXED - GameStorageService Registration Issue
**Problem:** `GameStorageService` class not found error
**Root Cause:** `GamesController` was calling non-existent `currentWorkspace()` method on User model
**Solution:** 
- Fixed `GamesController` to use session-based workspace selection
- Updated `index()`, `create()`, and `store()` methods to use `session('selected_workspace_id')`

### 2. üîß IN PROGRESS - Database Migration Issue
**Problem:** Migration trying to drop non-existent `share_token` column
**Status:** Partially fixed migration down() method, but still causing test failures
**Next Steps:** Need to resolve migration conflicts completely

### 3. üîß IDENTIFIED - Route Behavior Issues
**Problem:** Routes not behaving as expected (not redirecting when they should)
**Status:** Under investigation

## Routes Tested

### ‚úÖ Working Routes
- `/` - Landing page
- `/login` - Login page  
- `/register` - Registration page
- `/dashboard` - Dashboard (with authentication)
- `/profile` - Profile page
- `/company/billing` - Billing page
- `/templates` - Templates page

### ‚ùå Failing Routes
- `/games` - Games management (fixed controller, but still issues)
- `/settings` - Settings page
- `/history` - History page
- `/multiplayer` - Multiplayer page
- `/company/settings` - Company settings

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Database Migration Issues**
   - Resolve the `games` table migration conflicts
   - Ensure clean migration rollback/forward process

2. **Test All Controllers**
   - Check for similar `currentWorkspace()` method calls
   - Verify session-based workspace handling

3. **Complete Route Validation**
   - Test all authenticated routes with proper workspace setup
   - Verify redirect behavior for routes requiring workspace selection

4. **Create Comprehensive Test Suite**
   - Browser tests for all major user flows
   - API endpoint testing
   - Error handling validation

## Current Status

The application is partially functional with some routes working correctly. The main issues are:
- Database migration conflicts in testing environment
- Some routes may have similar workspace-related issues
- Need comprehensive testing of all application routes

**Next Action:** Fix remaining route issues and complete comprehensive testing.
