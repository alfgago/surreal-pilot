# Database Issues Fixed - SurrealPilot âœ…

**Date:** August 29, 2025  
**Status:** ðŸŸ¢ **ALL ISSUES RESOLVED**  
**Testing:** âœ… **ALL TESTS PASSING**

## ðŸ”§ Database Issues Identified and Fixed

### Issue 1: Companies Table Missing User Relationship
**Problem:** 
- Companies table required `user_id` field but tests weren't providing it
- Error: `NOT NULL constraint failed: companies.user_id`

**Solution:**
- Updated test to create User first, then Company with `user_id`
- Set proper relationship: `'user_id' => $user->id`

### Issue 2: Chat Conversations Missing User ID Field
**Problem:** 
- ChatConversation table was missing required `user_id` field
- Factory and model weren't configured for this relationship

**Solution:**
- Created migration: `2025_08_29_051541_add_user_id_to_chat_conversations_table.php`
- Added `user_id` foreign key with proper constraints
- Updated ChatConversation model fillable array
- Added user relationship method
- Updated ChatConversationFactory to include `user_id`

### Issue 3: Workspaces Missing Created By Field
**Problem:**
- Workspace factory trying to set `created_by` field that didn't exist
- Missing relationship to track who created the workspace

**Solution:**
- Created migration: `2025_08_29_051715_add_created_by_to_workspaces_table.php`
- Added nullable `created_by` foreign key to users table
- Updated Workspace model fillable array and added creator relationship
- Updated WorkspaceFactory to include `created_by`

### Issue 4: User Current Company Not Set
**Problem:**
- GameController expected `$user->currentCompany` but tests didn't set `current_company_id`
- Error: `"company_id":null` in API logs

**Solution:**
- Updated tests to set current company: `$user->update(['current_company_id' => $company->id])`

### Issue 5: Missing Service Methods
**Problem:**
- GameStorageService was missing several methods expected by GameController
- Methods: `invalidateConversationCaches`, `getPaginatedWorkspaceGames`, `getGameStats`, `updateGameMetadata`, `getPaginatedRecentGames`

**Solution:**
- Added `invalidateConversationCaches()` method to CacheService
- Added all missing methods to GameStorageService with proper implementations
- Fixed method signatures to match controller expectations
