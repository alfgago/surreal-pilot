# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The GDevelop Chat Integration will add a new game engine to SurrealPilot, enabling users to create and iterate on GDevelop games through an AI-powered chat interface without ever opening the GDevelop editor. The system will provide a web-based chat interface where users can request game modifications, receive real-time previews, and export their games as HTML5 builds. The integration will use GDevelop's open-source runtime headlessly in Node.js to generate and preview games entirely through terminal/CLI commands.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create GDevelop games through natural language chat requests, so that I can build games without learning the GDevelop editor interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I type "Make a tower defense game with 3 towers and enemies spawning from the left" THEN the system SHALL generate a complete GDevelop game.json with towers, enemies, and spawning mechanics
2. WHEN I request "Add a new tower type that shoots faster" THEN the system SHALL modify the existing game.json to include the new tower type without overwriting existing content
3. WHEN I ask to "Change enemies to green and make them move faster" THEN the system SHALL update enemy properties in the game.json accordingly
4. WHEN the AI processes my request THEN it SHALL first load the current game.json (if it exists) before making modifications
5. WHEN modifications are made THEN the system SHALL save the updated game.json and any new assets to the user's session storage
6. WHEN I start a new conversation THEN the system SHALL begin with a minimal valid GDevelop game.json template
7. WHEN changes are incremental THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing game elements unless explicitly asked to modify or remove them

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see real-time previews of my GDevelop game, so that I can immediately see the results of my chat requests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI updates my game THEN a "Preview" button SHALL appear in the chat interface within 2 seconds
2. WHEN I click the Preview button THEN the system SHALL load the game in an HTML5 iframe without restarting the server

4. WHEN I make subsequent changes THEN the preview SHALL reload dynamically with the updated game
5. WHEN the preview is displayed THEN it SHALL be fully interactive and playable
6. WHEN preview generation occurs THEN it SHALL use GDevelop's headless runtime without requiring the GUI
7. WHEN the game is complex THEN the preview SHALL load within 5 seconds on modern browsers

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to export my completed GDevelop game, so that I can download and distribute it independently.

5. WHEN deployment occurs THEN no GDevelop GUI installation SHALL be required on the server
6. WHEN the system operates THEN it SHALL use only free and open-source libraries for serving and file operations
7. WHEN maintenance is needed THEN all operations SHALL be accessible through terminal/CLI commands

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI to understand GDevelop game structure, so that it can make intelligent modifications to my games.

6. WHEN errors occur THEN the AI SHALL validate the generated JSON against GDevelop's schema requirements
7. WHEN complex requests are made THEN the AI SHALL break them down into appropriate GDevelop components and systems

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper session management and file storage, so that user games are preserved and organized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users create games THEN each session SHALL have isolated storage for game.json and assets
2. WHEN games are modified THEN the system SHALL maintain version history for rollback capabilities
3. WHEN sessions are active THEN game state SHALL persist across browser refreshes and reconnections
4. WHEN storage occurs THEN files SHALL be organized in a clear directory structure per user session
5. WHEN cleanup is needed THEN old sessions SHALL be automatically archived after configurable time periods
6. WHEN concurrent users exist THEN each SHALL have completely isolated game development environments
7. WHEN system restarts THEN active sessions SHALL be recoverable with their current game state

### Requirement 7
