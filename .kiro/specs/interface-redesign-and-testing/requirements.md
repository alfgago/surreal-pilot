# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Interface Redesign and Testing feature will restructure the Surreal Pilot user experience to first require engine selection and workspace registration before enabling chat functionality. This redesign introduces a multi-chat per workspace capability and includes comprehensive end-to-end testing using Puppeteer MCP to ensure all functionality works correctly. The system must validate the complete user journey from engine selection through game creation, storage, and management, with particular focus on PlayCanvas integration, chat persistence, game storage, and header navigation functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to select my engine type before accessing any chat functionality, so that the system can properly configure the appropriate tools and interface for my chosen development environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user first accesses the application THEN they SHALL be presented with an engine selection screen before any chat interface
2. WHEN engine options are displayed THEN they SHALL include PlayCanvas and Unreal Engine with clear descriptions
3. WHEN an engine is selected THEN the system SHALL configure the appropriate MCP servers and tools for that engine type
4. WHEN no engine is selected THEN chat functionality SHALL be disabled and inaccessible
5. WHEN an engine selection is made THEN the choice SHALL be persisted for the user session

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to register a workspace after selecting my engine, so that I can organize my projects and have a dedicated environment for development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an engine is selected THEN the user SHALL be prompted to register or select a workspace
2. WHEN registering a new workspace THEN the user SHALL provide a workspace name and description
3. WHEN a workspace is registered THEN it SHALL be associated with the selected engine type
4. WHEN workspace registration completes THEN the user SHALL gain access to chat functionality
5. WHEN multiple workspaces exist THEN users SHALL be able to switch between them
6. WHEN a workspace is selected THEN the interface SHALL display the workspace name and associated engine type

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to have multiple chat conversations per workspace, so that I can organize different aspects of my project development and maintain conversation history.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a workspace is active THEN users SHALL be able to create multiple chat conversations
2. WHEN creating a new chat THEN users SHALL be able to provide an optional chat title or description
3. WHEN multiple chats exist THEN they SHALL be displayed in a "Recent Chats" section with timestamps
4. WHEN switching between chats THEN conversation history SHALL be preserved and restored
5. WHEN a chat is created THEN it SHALL be automatically saved and persist across sessions
6. WHEN chats are listed THEN they SHALL show the most recent message preview and timestamp

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create PlayCanvas games through chat and have them properly stored, so that I can access and manage my game projects over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests to create a PlayCanvas game via chat THEN the system SHALL generate the game and store it in the workspace
2. WHEN a game is created THEN it SHALL appear in the "My Games" section with a preview thumbnail
3. WHEN games are stored THEN they SHALL include metadata such as creation date, last modified, and game title
4. WHEN a game is accessed from "My Games" THEN it SHALL load the playable version correctly
5. WHEN games are created THEN they SHALL be associated with the specific chat conversation that created them

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want my chat conversations to be saved and accessible in "Recent Chats", so that I can continue previous conversations and review my development history.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN chat conversations occur THEN they SHALL be automatically saved to the "Recent Chats" section
2. WHEN "Recent Chats" is accessed THEN it SHALL display conversations ordered by most recent activity
3. WHEN a chat from "Recent Chats" is selected THEN the full conversation history SHALL be restored
4. WHEN chats are saved THEN they SHALL include the workspace context and engine type
5. WHEN multiple chats exist THEN each SHALL maintain its own independent conversation thread

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the "My Games" section to work correctly, so that I can access and manage all my created games in one place.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN "My Games" is accessed THEN it SHALL display all games created within the current workspace
2. WHEN games are listed THEN they SHALL show game title, creation date, and preview thumbnail
3. WHEN a game is selected from "My Games" THEN it SHALL launch the playable version
4. WHEN games are displayed THEN they SHALL be organized by most recently created or modified
5. WHEN no games exist THEN "My Games" SHALL display an appropriate empty state with guidance

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure chat settings including AI model selection, so that I can customize my development experience according to my preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN "Chat Settings" is accessed THEN users SHALL be able to modify AI model preferences
2. WHEN AI_MODEL_PLAYCANVAS environment variable is set THEN it SHALL be available as a model option in settings
3. WHEN settings are changed THEN they SHALL be saved and applied to subsequent chat interactions
4. WHEN settings are saved THEN the user SHALL receive confirmation of successful save
5. WHEN settings are loaded THEN they SHALL reflect the current configuration including environment variables

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want all header navigation links to work correctly, so that I can access all application features without encountering broken links.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN header links are clicked THEN they SHALL navigate to the correct pages without errors
2. WHEN company/* links exist in the header THEN they SHALL be updated to use correct routing patterns
3. WHEN navigation occurs THEN users SHALL not encounter 404 errors or broken page states
4. WHEN all header links are tested THEN they SHALL provide appropriate functionality for their intended purpose
5. WHEN header navigation is used THEN it SHALL maintain consistent styling and user experience

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive Puppeteer MCP testing to validate the entire application flow, so that I can ensure all functionality works correctly before deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Puppeteer MCP tests run THEN they SHALL test the complete user journey from engine selection to game creation
2. WHEN authentication is required THEN tests SHALL use the provided credentials (alfgago@gmail.com / 123Test!)
3. WHEN testing PlayCanvas functionality THEN tests SHALL verify game creation, storage, and retrieval
4. WHEN testing chat functionality THEN tests SHALL verify message sending, conversation saving, and "Recent Chats" functionality
