# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for migrating all existing SurrealPilot Laravel Blade views to the new redesign system. The redesign introduces a modern, clean interface with improved component architecture, consistent styling using a new color scheme, and better user experience patterns. The migration will ensure all existing functionality is preserved while adopting the new visual design and component structure.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Component System Migration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all existing views to use the new component system, so that the interface is consistent and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating views THEN all existing Blade components SHALL be replaced with new redesign components from `redesign/resources/views/components/`
2. WHEN using UI components THEN the new `x-ui.button`, `x-ui.badge`, `x-ui.card` components SHALL be used consistently
3. WHEN creating layouts THEN the new `redesign/resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php` structure SHALL be adopted
4. WHEN implementing icons THEN the new icon components from `redesign/resources/views/components/icons/` SHALL be used
5. WHEN building chat interfaces THEN the new chat components (`x-chat.composer`, `x-chat.thread-list`, `x-chat.game-preview`) SHALL be integrated

### Requirement 2: Visual Design System Update

**User Story:** As a user, I want the interface to have a modern, consistent visual design, so that the application feels cohesive and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing any page THEN the new color scheme with mint green accents SHALL be applied consistently
2. WHEN interacting with elements THEN the new CSS variables and design tokens SHALL be used
3. WHEN viewing cards and containers THEN the new rounded corners, shadows, and spacing SHALL be applied
4. WHEN using typography THEN the new font system (Space Grotesk for headings, DM Sans for body) SHALL be implemented
5. WHEN viewing the interface THEN the new background colors and border styles SHALL be consistent across all views

### Requirement 3: Layout Structure Modernization

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application layout to be modern and responsive, so that I can use it effectively on different devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the main interface THEN the new header component with workspace switcher SHALL be implemented
2. WHEN navigating the application THEN the new sidebar design with proper navigation SHALL be used
3. WHEN using the chat interface THEN the adaptive layout (full-width for Unreal, split-view for PlayCanvas) SHALL be implemented
4. WHEN viewing on mobile THEN the responsive design patterns from the redesign SHALL be applied
5. WHEN switching between sections THEN the new tab-based navigation system SHALL be functional

### Requirement 4: Existing Functionality Preservation

**User Story:** As a user, I want all existing features to continue working after the redesign migration, so that my workflow is not disrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the chat interface THEN all existing chat functionality (sending messages, conversation management, streaming responses) SHALL work unchanged
2. WHEN managing workspaces THEN all workspace selection and switching functionality SHALL be preserved
3. WHEN viewing game history THEN all existing history and patch management features SHALL remain functional
4. WHEN accessing settings THEN all configuration options and API key management SHALL work as before
5. WHEN using authentication THEN all login, registration, and user management features SHALL be preserved

### Requirement 5: Engine-Specific Interface Adaptation

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want the interface to adapt to my chosen game engine, so that I get relevant tools and layout optimizations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using PlayCanvas THEN the interface SHALL show the split-view layout with chat and game preview side-by-side
2. WHEN using Unreal Engine THEN the interface SHALL show the full-width chat layout without game preview
3. WHEN switching engines THEN the workspace indicator and styling SHALL update appropriately
4. WHEN viewing engine-specific features THEN the relevant tools and options SHALL be displayed
5. WHEN using mobile devices THEN the engine-specific adaptations SHALL work responsively

### Requirement 6: Component Reusability and Consistency

**User Story:** As a developer, I want components to be reusable and consistent, so that maintenance is easier and the interface is cohesive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating new views THEN existing redesign components SHALL be reused rather than creating duplicates
2. WHEN styling elements THEN consistent variant patterns (primary, secondary, outline, ghost) SHALL be used
3. WHEN implementing forms THEN the standardized form components and validation styles SHALL be applied
4. WHEN showing status information THEN consistent badge and indicator components SHALL be used
5. WHEN building modals and overlays THEN the standardized modal patterns SHALL be followed

### Requirement 7: Performance and Loading States

**User Story:** As a user, I want the interface to load quickly and show appropriate loading states, so that I understand when the system is processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pages are loading THEN appropriate loading indicators SHALL be displayed using the new design system
2. WHEN API calls are in progress THEN loading states SHALL use consistent spinner and skeleton patterns
3. WHEN content is streaming THEN the interface SHALL handle real-time updates smoothly
4. WHEN images or assets are loading THEN placeholder states SHALL follow the new design patterns
5. WHEN errors occur THEN error states SHALL use the consistent error styling and messaging

### Requirement 8: Accessibility and Usability

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the interface to be accessible and usable, so that I can effectively use the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigating with keyboard THEN all interactive elements SHALL be properly focusable with visible focus indicators
2. WHEN using screen readers THEN all components SHALL have appropriate ARIA labels and semantic markup
3. WHEN viewing with high contrast needs THEN the color scheme SHALL maintain sufficient contrast ratios
4. WHEN using touch devices THEN all interactive elements SHALL have appropriate touch targets
5. WHEN viewing with reduced motion preferences THEN animations SHALL respect user preferences
