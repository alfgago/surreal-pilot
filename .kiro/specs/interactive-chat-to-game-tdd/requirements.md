# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Enhanced PlayCanvas Chat Experience will improve the existing PlayCanvas integration with real-time preview functionality, game sharing capabilities, and custom domain publishing. The system will enhance the current chat interface to show AI thinking processes (similar to open-lovable), provide a right sidebar preview with fullscreen support, enable one-click game sharing, and guide users through custom domain setup that automatically maps DNS to game folders. The feature will be tested by creating a Tower Defense game through the existing PlayCanvas chat functionality to demonstrate all capabilities working together.
