   - Resolved foreign key constraint ordering
   - Updated migration timestamps

2. **User Authentication**
   - Created test user with proper company association
   - Verified login flow works end-to-end
   - Confirmed session management

3. **Test Infrastructure**
   - Fixed ES module vs CommonJS conflicts
   - Created working Puppeteer test scripts
   - Established screenshot capture workflow

### New Features Documented

#### API Endpoints Added
- `GET /api/engines` - Available engines
- `POST /api/user/engine-preference` - Set engine preference
- `GET /api/workspaces/{id}/conversations` - Workspace conversations
- `POST /api/workspaces/{id}/conversations` - Create conversation
- `GET /api/conversations/{id}/messages` - Conversation messages
- `POST /api/conversations/{id}/messages` - Add message
- `GET /api/workspaces/{id}/games` - Workspace games
- `POST /api/workspaces/{id}/games` - Create game
- `GET /api/chat/settings` - Chat settings
- `POST /api/chat/settings` - Save settings

#### Database Schema Changes
- `chat_conversations` table with workspace relationships
- `chat_messages` table with conversation relationships  
- `games` table with workspace and conversation relationships
- `selected_engine_type` column added to users table
- Performance indexes for optimized queries

#### Frontend Components

### Deployment Scripts Prepared

#### Migration Script
```bash
# Run database migrations
php artisan migrate

# Seed required data
php artisan db:seed

# Clear caches
php artisan config:clear
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan view:clear
```

#### Rollback Procedures
```bash
# Rollback migrations if needed
php artisan migrate:rollback --step=10

# Restore from backup
# (Database backup procedures should be in place)
```

### Performance Optimizations Implemented

1. **Database Indexes**
   - Composite indexes for workspace queries
   - Conversation message ordering indexes
   - Game listing performance indexes
   - Cross-table relationship indexes

2. **Query Optimization**
   - Pagination for large datasets
   - Efficient conversation loading
   - Optimized game retrieval

3. **Caching Strategy**
   - Recent chats caching
   - User preferences caching
   - Engine configuration caching

### Testing Artifacts Generated
