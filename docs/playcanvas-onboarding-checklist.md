# PlayCanvas Onboarding Checklist

## 5-Minute Game Publishing Workflow ✅

Use this checklist to ensure you can create and publish a game in under 5 minutes:

### Pre-Setup (One-time, 30 seconds)
- [ ] Access Surreal Pilot workspace
- [ ] Verify mobile browser compatibility (Chrome, Safari, Firefox)
- [ ] Check internet connection stability
- [ ] Bookmark the workspace URL for quick access

### Game Creation (1 minute)
- [ ] **0:00-0:15** - Tap "New Prototype" button
- [ ] **0:15-0:30** - Select template (FPS, Third-Person, 2D Platformer, or Tower Defense)
- [ ] **0:30-1:00** - Wait for workspace initialization (should complete in 15-30 seconds)

### Basic Modification (2-3 minutes)
- [ ] **1:00-1:30** - Type first modification command (e.g., "make the player jump higher")
- [ ] **1:30-2:00** - Wait for AI processing and preview update
- [ ] **2:00-2:30** - Type second modification (e.g., "add particle effects when jumping")
- [ ] **2:30-3:00** - Type third modification (e.g., "change background color to blue")
- [ ] **3:00-4:00** - Test modifications by tapping "Preview"

### Publishing (30 seconds)
- [ ] **4:00-4:15** - Tap "Publish" button
- [ ] **4:15-4:45** - Wait for build completion (typically 20-30 seconds)
- [ ] **4:45-5:00** - Copy and test the generated public URL

### Verification
- [ ] Game loads in under 1 second on mobile
- [ ] Touch controls work properly (if applicable)
- [ ] All modifications are visible in the published version
- [ ] URL is shareable and works on other devices

## Troubleshooting Quick Fixes

### If initialization takes longer than 30 seconds:
- [ ] Refresh the page and try again
- [ ] Check internet connection
- [ ] Try a different template
- [ ] Clear browser cache

### If modifications don't apply:
- [ ] Check for typos in commands
- [ ] Try simpler, more specific commands
- [ ] Wait for previous command to complete before sending next
- [ ] Use example commands from documentation

### If publishing fails:
- [ ] Ensure workspace is in "ready" status
- [ ] Check company credit balance
- [ ] Try publishing again after 1 minute
- [ ] Contact support if issue persists

### If game doesn't load on mobile:
- [ ] Test on different mobile browser
- [ ] Check mobile data/WiFi connection
- [ ] Try incognito/private browsing mode
- [ ] Clear browser cache and cookies

## Success Metrics
