- Wave System: 10 waves with progressive difficulty
- Economy System: Currency and tower costs
- Special Abilities: Freeze effects, piercing damage
```

**Conversation Flow Tracked:**
- Initial creation request → AI response with game structure
- 5 feedback interactions → Incremental improvements
- Each modification properly versioned and stored
- AI thinking process captured for each response

### 2. Platformer Game Validation
```php
// Created physics-based platformer with:
- Player Character: PlatformerObject with advanced movement
- Physics Systems: Double jump, wall jumping, wall sliding
- Level Design: 3 levels with increasing difficulty
- Interactive Elements: Moving platforms, collectibles, power-ups
- Mobile Controls: Touch-friendly interface elements
```

**Physics Features Validated:**
- Jump height modifications (300 → 450 pixels)
- Double jump mechanics implementation
- Wall interaction systems (jumping, sliding)
- Platform movement and collision detection

### 3. Puzzle Game Validation
```php
// Created match-3 puzzle with:
- Grid System: 8x8 gem grid with drag mechanics
- Special Gems: BombGem (3x3 explosion), LineGem (row/column clear)
- Logic Systems: Combo multipliers, move limits, scoring
- Obstacles: LockedGem (multi-hit), IceBlock (destructible)
- Power-ups: Shuffle, extra moves, hint system
```

**Logic Systems Validated:**
- Match detection and cascade mechanics
